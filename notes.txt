Q - how to tell difference between sensor and subject in rep file?

Q - does everything get added to state table?

Q - how to add entries to Entry table that appears as foreign keys in several other tables
    A - although all uuid keys have a default function to generate a uuid, need to create one in entry table first and use that

- ideas:
  - when seeing foreign refs in file need to check if already known in memory
  - if not known in memory search for it in DB
  - if not in DB see if can be created for known or contextural info to create new entry
  - if not look for data in .ini files to create new entry

- poc limitations:
  - just long/lat to indicate position
  - hardcoded refs to other tables (for now)
