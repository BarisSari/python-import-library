Q - how to tell difference between sensor and subject in rep file?
    A - all uncommented lines will refer to platforms
    A - sensors defined by ;SENSOR pragmas?
Q - does everything get added to state table?
    A - all vessel tracks yet, contacts and activations can come from pragmas
Q - how to add entries to Entry table that appears as foreign keys in several other tables
    A - although all uuid keys have a default function to generate a uuid, need to create one in entry table first and use that
Q - All the table names seem to be quoted, could they just be plain names?
Q - Is it ok to use constants for the TableTypes? (could be data member of each DB class)
    Or does it need a mechanism to automatically lookup or insert table type?
Q - Not all tables with UUIDs seem to be foreign keyed to Entry table? eg. DatafileTypes
Q - Should I validate string lengths for DB fields against file entries?
Q - when looking for matching Datafile, use reference for filename? or always just add every time?
Q - Main confusion, State table just refers to sensors, not to platforms. Although lines in REP files are all platform movements, not sensor movements

- ideas:
  - when seeing foreign refs in file need to check if already known in memory. DONE - Datstore caches
  - if not known in memory search for it in DB. DONE - query methods when adding elements
  - if not in DB see if can be created for known or contextural info to create new entry. DONE - create new rows
  - if not look for data in .ini files to create new entry
  - Use with: or some other mechanism to start transaction, and always commit or rollback at end without explicit calls

- poc limitations:
  - just long/lat to indicate position
  - hardcoded refs to other tables (for now)
